  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>How do I check if a book is available?</h3>
  <p>
    Use the search on the main page. The book will show as Available or Checked Out.
    If it is checked out, you can join the waitlist.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I find a study space?</h3>
  <p>
    Open the Study Spaces section to see which areas have open seats before
    you walk around the library.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I get reminders about due dates?</h3>
  <p>
    When you borrow a book, the system automatically sets a due date and sends
    a reminder before it is due.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I still need help?</h3>
