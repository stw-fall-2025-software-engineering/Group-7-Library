# Group-7-Library
Group-7 repo for Smart Library project

# Description
The purpose of this repository is to help create a prototype for a Smart Library. The end goal for this prototype is to create a smarter, faster, and more efficient library experience that saves students' time and enhances engagement with library resources.

# Test to see if we can commit changes
I had to import the repo to the software engineering organization so it would show up with the rest of the class repo's.
